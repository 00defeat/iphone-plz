# iphone-plz

When the 14 pros came out they were pretty popylar. This was a quick prototype to notify me when an iPhone 14 Pro became available. It checks [every hour](/.github/workflows/schedule.yml#L5) during apples opening times (10am - 6pm) and sends a SMS if/when one is available.

### Technology

You can find this inspecting the source on the apple store page, you can also try evaluating `window.pageLevelData.rightRailSummarySection.defaultOnloadPart` in the web dev console.
